A solar eclipse happens when the Moon is directly between our Sun and Earth, causing the Moon to cast a shadow onto Earth.

Because the Earth, Moon, and Sun are moving, the shadow traces a path across the Earth.

This area is called the "path of totality." Only people inside this path will see the Sun completely blocked from view by the Moon. <b>Hendrix College is lucky to be inside the path of totality for the April 8, 2024 eclipse</b>. The last time a total eclipse happened in Arkansas was 1918, and the next time it will happen (after the 2024 eclipse) is 2045.
