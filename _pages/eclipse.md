A solar eclipse happens when the Moon is directly between our Sun and Earth, causing the Moon to cast a shadow onto Earth. Only people inside of the shadowed area on Earth will see the Sun completely blocked from view by the Moon. This area is called the "path of totality." Hendrix College is lucky to be inside the path of totality for the April 8, 2024 eclipse.

 Please be aware that looking directly at the Sun during any time except totality can result in severe and permanent eye injury. Eclipse glasses, telescopes with solar filters, and other safe viewing methods will be available at the event.
