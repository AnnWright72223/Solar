There will be safe viewing opportunities with free eclipse glasses, telescopes with solar filters, and projections of the Sun. Join us for games, food, merchandise, music, and art to make the day a celebration to remember.

We would like to thank the Arkansas Space Grant Consortium, the Charles Prentiss Hough Odyssey Professor sponsors, and Hendrix College for providing resources for this event.
